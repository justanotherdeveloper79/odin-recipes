# Odin Recipes

This is my first project from The Odin Project Foundations course.

The goal of this project was to build a basic recipe website using only HTML.  
It consists of a main index page with links to individual recipe pages.

The focus of this project was not design, but practicing core HTML concepts and learning how to structure a website.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Writing semantic HTML
- Creating multiple HTML pages
- Linking pages together using relative paths
- Adding headings, lists and images
- Organizing files into folders using the Command Line Interface
- Creating a basic project repository
- Using Git and GitHub (clone, add, commit, push)

## Project Structure

- `index.html` - Main homepage
- `recipes/` - Folder containing individual recipe pages
- `img/` - Images included for each recipe

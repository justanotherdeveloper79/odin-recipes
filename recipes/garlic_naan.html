    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Garlic naan is a popular, leavened Indian flatbread known for its soft, fluffy, and slightly chewy texture, topped with a generous layer of minced garlic and butter.<br>Traditionally baked in a tandoor (clay oven), it develops a slightly charred, bubbly exterior. <br>It is a versatile, savory bread often served alongside rich curries, and dals.</p>

    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup warm water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>¼ cup butter</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 cups bread flour</li>
        <li>¼ cup plain yogurt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped cilantro</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine water, sugar, and yeast in a bowl. <br>Let stand until yeast softens and forms a creamy foam, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat butter in a pan over medium heat until melted and sizzling. <br>Quickly mix in garlic and remove from the heat.</li>
        <li>Add bread flour, yogurt, salt, and 1 tablespoon garlic butter to yeast mixture; stir with a wooden spoon until a shaggy dough forms. <br>Knead by hand until dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl, adding more water or flour as needed. <br>Turn dough out onto the counter and continue kneading until it forms a smooth ball, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place dough into a large bowl and drizzle a few spoons garlic butter over top. <br>Cover and let rise until doubled in volume, about 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Punch dough down and turn out onto the counter. <br>Shape into a rough rectangle and cut into 6 pieces. Roll each piece into a ball and lightly dust with flour. <br>Cover with plastic wrap and proof until slightly puffy, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat a cast iron skillet over medium heat until very hot, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, roll each piece proofed dough into a 1/8-inch-thick oval. <br>Sprinkle some cilantro on top and press lightly to adhere.</li>
        <li>Working in batches, cook naan in the hot skillet until large bubbles form, 1 to 2 minutes. <br>Flip, press gently, and continue to cook until bubbles on the bottom are charred, 2 to 3 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Brush naan with more garlic butter before serving.</li>
    </ol>
